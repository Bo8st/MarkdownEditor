# MarkdownEditor

This project is to create a website which allows the user to create notes on the website and store them using Markdown languages.
The notes can be made either with Markdown, Latex or HTML. Users would be able to create and store notes on the website.

## The plan of the website

The website would be build using Next.js and written in Typescript.
It also uses Neon database on Postgresql with REST API built from Express to form the communication
between the website and database. This is just the basic plan ,but it is subject to change.

### The current ideas of the website

- Setup and implement Neon Database (might build local database too)
- Setup and build REST API with Express
- Protect routes of REST API with JWT
- Add support for markdown languages (Marked.js, etc.)
- Create simple website with Next.js
